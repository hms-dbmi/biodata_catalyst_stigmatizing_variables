Verified outcomes for OS and CT include all cancers, fractures (all fractures for CT; hip fracture only for OS), and cardiovascular outcomes, except DVT and PE. DVT and PE are only verified for HT participants. The outcomes for which central adjudication is required for all OS and CT participants are hip fracture, in situ breast, invasive breast, colon, endometrium, ovary, rectosigmoid junction and rectum cancers. In addition, for CT participants, central adjudication is required for death.

2029	\Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial and Observational Study ( phs000200 )\The subject sample mapping data table includes a mapping of subject IDs to sample IDs. Included are samples from WHI SHARe, GO-ESP, GARNET, CARe, PAGE, Imputation, WHIMS+, and BA23 CHD. Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes a mapping of sample IDs to other sample ID aliases, the substudy (phs accession) that the sample belongs to, and sample use.\Sample use. Array_DNA_Methylation: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using methylation arrays, quantitative methylation measurements at the single-CpG-site level; Array_SNP: SNP genotypes obtained using standard or custom microarrays; Array_miRNA_Expression: Expression data for microRNA samples (array data); Imputation_SNP: Imputed SNP genotypes; PCR_DNA_SNP: SNP genotypes obtained using PCR amplified DNA; Seq_DNA_SNP: SNP genotypes derived from sequence data; Seq_DNA_WholeExome: Whole exome sequencing; Seq_DNA_WholeGenome: Whole genome sequencing\	Sample use.
