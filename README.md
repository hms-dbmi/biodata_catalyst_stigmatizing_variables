<b>STIGMATIZING VARIABLES</b>
<p>The PIC-SURE Open Access dataset excludes stigmatizing variables from the following categories: Mental health diagnoses/history/treatment; Illicit drug use history; Sexually transmitted disease diagnoses/history/treatment; Sexual history; Intellectual Achievement/Ability/Educational Attainment; Direct or surrogate identifiers of legal status.</p>
<p>This repo includes scripts that identify stigmatizing variables in the BioData Catalyst PIC-SURE dataset. The repo also hosts the list of stigmatizing variables that are removed from PIC-SURE Open Access each data refresh. </p>
<p>The identification of stigmatizing variables is an evolving process. If you have suggestions, comments, or questions please [contact us](https://bdcatalyst.freshdesk.com/support/home). </p>
