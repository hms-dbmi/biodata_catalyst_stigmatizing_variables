However, many of the phenotype measurements are shared betweeen the MESA Classic and MESA Air Exams. Variables included in the MESA Air Exam are those from standard questionnaires, clinical and laboratory measurements. The questionnaires include variables of demography, socioeconomic and psychosocial status, medical and family history, medication use, dietary and alcohol intakes, smoking, and physical activity. The clinical measurements include anthropometry, blood pressure, ankle/brachial blood pressure indices, ECG, coronary calcium determination, arterial wave forms, and flow-dependent brachial artery vasodilation.
